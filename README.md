# Covid-19 Chest X-ray Classifier

An automated machine learning model to assist in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in chest x-ray images

### Motivation
PTPCR is one of most effective way in detecting the Covid-19 but this test is very time consuming which may take hours to days and require special kit which may not be available in some place. On the contrary, the rapid antigen test looks for presence of antigens of the virus from a nasal swab but may go inaccurate.
Serological test searches for the anti-bodies in the patient’s blood samples. As it only checks the IgM and IgG antibodies during or after recovery and will not help to detect the virus early. Chest X-rays use invisible ranges of electro – magnetic spectrum to detect any anomaly and make early detection possible. The prediction of doctor by seeing X-ray may or may not be correct all the time. To overcome all these issues in this project we are aimed to build a Machine learning/ Deep learning model to assist in the diagnosis of Covid-19 infection in Chest X-ray images.

### Dataset
The Dataset used for training the model is taken from Kaggle which consist of 4044 Covid and 5500 Normal/Non-Covid Chest X-rays. The link for the dataset can be find here
